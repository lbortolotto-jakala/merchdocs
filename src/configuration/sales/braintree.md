**Payment Services Directive Requirements:** <br/>
As of September 14, 2019, European banks might decline payments that do not meet [PSD2]({% link stores/compliance-payment-services-directive.md %}) requirements. Starting with Magento ver. 2.2.3, Braintree provides native support for 3D Secure 2.0.<br/>To meet PSD2 requirements for earlier versions of Magento, install and configure the official Braintree payment integration extension from [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=braintree). Older Braintree implementations that run on JavaScript SDK v2 do not support 3D Secure 2.0.
