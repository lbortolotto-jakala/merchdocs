Use the Products content type to add a list of products to the stage. You also can use the [Add Content - Block]({% link cms/page-builder-add-content-block.md %}) tool to place the block, with product list, on the Page Builder stage. Or, you can add the product list directly to a row on a page.

The following example shows how to add a product list to a block. A [widget]({% link cms/widgets.md %}) can then be used to place the block at a specific location on any page in your store.
