Use the Text content type to add a container and text editor with a “What You See Is What You Get” view of the content to the stage. In addition, you can add links, images, [variables]({% link marketing/variables.md %}), and widgets to the text from the editor toolbar. You can access the text editor directly from the stage or from the toolbox Settings. Changes made directly to the stage are saved automatically. To learn more, see [Using the Editor]({% link cms/editor.md %}).

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

## To add a link

The Insert Link button in the editor makes it easy to add a hyperlink to an image in the gallery. However, it can also be used to create an inline link in text, provided that you have the URL in advance. Unlike the Widget button, the Insert/Edit link button is not integrated with pages, products, or categories in the store.

To create a link for a telephone number or email, see [Adding Custom Variables]({% link marketing/variables-custom.md %}).

1. In the storefront, navigate to the page that is to be the target destination for the link. You can either paste the fully qualified URL or a relative URL that omits the reference to your store domain.

   | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
   | Full URL     | https://mystore.com/women/tops-women/tees-women.html |
   | Relative URL | ../women/tops-women/tees-women.html                  |

1. In the text editor, select the `Shop Tees >` text in the third line. Then, choose **Bold** (![]({% link images/images/editor4-toolbar/btn-bold.png %}){: .Inline}) on the editor toolbar.

1. Again select the "Shop Tees >" text in the third line. Then, choose **Insert/edit link** (![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-add-link.png %}){: .Inline}) on the editor toolbar.

   _Formatted Text_

1. In the **Url** field, enter the relative link that you prepared.

1. Set **Target** to `None`.

   This setting opens the page in the same browser window, rather than opening a new tab.

1. In the **Title** field, enter `Shop Tees`.

   The Title link attribute is used by some browsers as a tooltip.

1. Click <span class="btn">OK</span> to save the link and return to the Page Builder workspace.

## To change text settings

1. Hover over the text container. Then, choose **Settings** ( ![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-settings.png %}){: .Inline}) in the toolbox.

   {: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
   Because the text container is tightly nested inside another container, make sure that you have the correct toolbox.

1. Update the content and settings as needed using the [descriptions](#text-settings) at the end of this page for reference.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span> and return to the Page Builder workspace. Then, click <span class="btn">Save</span> to save the page.
