DEPRECATED: [Page Builder]({% link cms/page-builder.md %})’s advanced content tools replace the previous banner functionality as described in this topic. We keep this content in the user guide as a convenience for those whose stores have customizations that prevent them from using Page Builder.

Any banners you create can be associated with both catalog and cart price rules for a promotion. To associate a banner with a price rule, you must first create both the banner and the price rule. Related banners can be associated with a price rule from the Banner tool, or from either the [Cart Price Rule]({% link marketing/price-rules-cart.md %}) or [Catalog Price Rule]({% link marketing/price-rules-catalog.md %}) tool.

## To associate a banner with a price rule:

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Marketing** > _Promotions_ and choose one of the following:

    - **Catalog Price Rule**
    - **Cart Price Rules**

1. In the grid, open the rule where you want to associate the banner. Then, do the following:

    - Scroll down and expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}){: .Inline} **Related Banners** to display the lists of available Cart and Catalog Price Rules.

    - If necessary, use the search filters to find the price rule(s) that you want. Then, select the checkbox of each banner that you want to associate with the price rule.

    If your banners don’t appear in the grid, click **Reset Filter**.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Rule</span>.
