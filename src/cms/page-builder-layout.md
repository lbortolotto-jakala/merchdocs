The Layout section of the Page Builder panel is used to add rows, columns, or tabs to the stage. When a content type is dragged from the panel to the stage, a container appears with a toolbox of options that are specific to the content type.

By default, the Page Builder stage has an initial row. Additional content types can be dragged from the panel to the stage, and placed either inside the row, or positioned above or below the row, according to type.

_Panel with Layout Content Types and Stage_

### Layout Content Types

| Content type  | Description |
| -------- |-------- |
| [Row]({% link cms/page-builder-layout-row.md %}) | The row is the primary content type. All other content types are added to an existing row. A new row can be dragged from the panel to the stage, and positioned either above or below another row. You can also use the Duplicate option to make a copy of an existing row. |
| [Column]({% link cms/page-builder-layout-column.md %}) | A column can be dragged from the panel to a row. The maximum number of columns that can be added is determined by the number of grid divisions that is specified in the [configuration]({% link cms/page-builder-setup.md %}). |
| [Tabs]({% link cms/page-builder-layout-tabs.md %}) | A single tab can be dragged from the panel to a row. Additional tabs can be added from the toolbox. |
