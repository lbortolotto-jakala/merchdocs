The Catalog Events Carousel widget displays a slider of upcoming events with a countdown ticker for each event. You can choose the page(s) and area of the page layout where the carousel is to appear, and control the width and number of events that appear at a time. The result you get depends on your theme, where it’s positioned to appear on the page, and the options that you choose.
