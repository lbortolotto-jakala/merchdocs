DEPRECATED: [Page Builder]({% link cms/page-builder.md %})â€™s advanced content tools replace the previous banner functionality as described in this topic. We keep this content in the user guide as a convenience for those whose stores have customizations that prevent them from using Page Builder.

A banner rotator can be used to display a single banner, or multiple banners in a specific sequence or random order. The next banner in the sequence appears whenever the page is refreshed.

The banner rotator is a widget that can be assigned to a specific page, product, or category, and placed most anywhere in your store. In addition, banner rotators can be associated with a specific cart or catalog price rule.

## Step 1: Create the Individual Banners

Create the individual [banners]({% link cms/banner-create.md %}) that you want to include in the rotator.

## Step 2: Add a Widget

Follow the basic steps to add a [widget]({% link cms/widget-create.md %}).

- Set **Type** to `Banner Rotator`.

- Under **Layout Updates**, choose the page and location where the banner rotator is to appear.

## Step 3: Configure the Banner Rotator

1. In the left panel, choose **Widget Options**. Then, do the following:

   - Set **Banners to Display** to `Specified Banners`.

   - (Optional) To limit the banner to a certain area of the page, set **Restrict by Banner Types** to the place on the page where you want the banner to appear.

   - Set **Rotation Mode** to one of the following:

      - `Do not rotate, display all at once`
      - `One at a time, Random`
      - `One at a time, Series`
      - `One at a time, Shuffle`

2. To choose the banners to be included in the rotator, do the following:

   - In the _Specify Banners_ section, use Search to find the banners you want to include. If necessary, click <span class="btn">Reset Filter</span> to list all the available banners.

   - Select the checkbox of each banner you want to include in the rotator.

   - To set the sequence of each banner in relation to the others, enter a number in the **Position** column. To place a banner in the first position, enter `1`.

3. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.
