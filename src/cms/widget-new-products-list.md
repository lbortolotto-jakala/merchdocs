title: New Products List
---

The list of new products is an example of dynamic content, and consists of live data that is pulled from your product catalog. By default, the “New Products” list includes the first eight of the most recently added products. However, it can also be configured to include only products within a specified date range.

## Step 1: Set the Date Range for Each Product

To make a product appear in the list by date range, the “New From” dates must be entered in the product. The product then appears in the New Products list during the date range specified.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Products**.

1. Find each product that you want to feature, and open in edit mode. Then, do the following:

    - In the **Set Product as New From** field, click the calendar (![]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %}){: .Inline}). Then, choose the first date that you want the product to be featured.

    - In the **To** field, click the calendar (![]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %}){: .Inline}). Then, choose the last date that you want the product to be featured.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

    The list of products now appears on the Home Page for the specified date range.

## Step 2: Create the Widget

The code that determines the content of the New Products list and its placement in your store is generated by the Widget tool.

1. In the Settings section, do the following:

    - Set **Type** to `Catalog New Products List`.

    - Choose the **Design Theme** that is used by the store.

1. Click <span class="btn">Continue</span>.

    For now, you can ignore the message to refresh the cache.

## Step 4: Configure the List

1. In the panel on the left, choose **Widget Options**.

1. Set **Display Products** to one of the following:

    | All Products | Lists products in sequence, starting with those most recently added. |
    | New Products | Lists only the products which are identified as “New”. A product is considered to be new during the date range that is specified in the “Set Product As New From/To” fields. The list will be empty if the date range expires without any new products defined. |

1. Complete the remaining information as follows:

    - To provide navigation control for lists with multiple pages, set **Display Page Control** to “Yes”. Then, in the **Number of Products per Page** field, enter the number of products you want to appear on each page.

    - Set **Number of Products to Display** to the number of new products that you want to include in the list. The default setting is 10.

    - In the **Cache Lifetime (Seconds)** field, choose how often you want to refresh the list of new products. By default, the cache is set to 86400 seconds, or 24 hours.
