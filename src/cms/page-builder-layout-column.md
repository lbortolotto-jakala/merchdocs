Use the Column content type to divide a row into multiple columns. When a column is added to an empty row, the row is initially divided into two columns of equal width. You can add or remove columns, as needed. A column can be resized by dragging the border between two columns. The width of the next column is adjusted to fill the available space in the row. If a row has only a single column, it extends the full width of the row.

Each column has a toolbox of options that appears when you hover over the container.

_Adding a Column_

The [grid]({% link cms/page-builder-workspace.md %}) ensures that content is aligned consistently in a column and helps the page render correctly on both desktop and mobile devices. To learn more, see the [Advanced Content Tools]({% link cms/page-builder-setup.md %}) section of the Page Builder configuration.

_Grid Divisions on Row with One Column_

The numbers in parentheses (6 /12) in the top border of each column container indicate the number of grid divisions in each column and the total number of divisions in the row.

## To add a column

1. In the Page Builder panel under **Layout**, drag a **Column** to the row.

    _Drag Column to Row_

    The row is now divided into two columns of equal width. Each column is a separate container for content and has its own set of toolbox options.

    _Row with Two Equal Columns_

1. In the upper-left corner of the row, click the **Grid** control (![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-grid-control.png %}){: .Inline_larger}).

    Positioning content on the grid helps to align content consistently and renders the page correctly on both desktop and mobile devices. To learn more, see the [Advanced Content Tools]({% link configuration/general/content-management.md %}) section of the Page Builder configuration.

## To resize a column

1. Hover over the border between two columns.

    The border is highlighted and the toolbox for the selected column appears.

    _Highlighted Border Between Two Columns_

1. Hold down the mouse button to show the grid. Then, drag the border to a new position on the grid. The width of both columns adjusts to reflect the change.

    The new width of each column appears after the label, such as `4/12` (four out of twelve) and `8/12` (eight out of twelve).

## To remove a column

1. Hover over the column that you want to remove. Then, choose **Remove** ( ![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-remove.png %}){: .Inline}) in the toolbox.

    _Toolbox_

1. If the column contains content, click **OK** to confirm.

    To speed up the process in the future, you can remove the confirmation step by selecting the **Do not show this again** checkbox.

    The row now has a single column (12/12) and grid. Because the grid is available only for columns, you can use this technique to show the grid for any row.

    _Single Column with Grid_

1. If you want the column to extend the full width of the row, hover over over the column. Then, choose **Settings** (![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-settings.png %}){: .Inline}) in the toolbox and do the following:

    - Scroll down to the **Advanced** section.

    - Set all four **Padding** values to zero (0).
