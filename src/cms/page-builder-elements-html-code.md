Use the HTML Code content type to add snippets of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to the stage. For example, you might want to add custom HTML, declare a CSS class that can be applied to an element on the page, or add a snippet of code for a logo, button, or banner that you received from a third-party provider.

In the following example, you will learn how to embed [Google Font][1] code and declare custom heading classes that override the current stylesheet.

## Step 1: Choose a Google Font

1. Visit the [Google Fonts][1] site and choose the font family that you want to use.

   ![]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-elements-html-code-google-fonts.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Google Fonts Site_

1. Copy the generated code that is to be embedded in the `<head>` section of the page and paste it temporarily into a text editor.

   - Embed Font code
   - CSS Rule

1. Add the font-family rule to each heading class. Then, enclose the heading classes in a `<style>` tag. This is the code that will be pasted into Page Builder.

   ```html
   <style>
      h1 {color: teal; font-family: 'Khand', sans-serif; }
      h2 {color: teal; font-family: 'Khand', sans-serif; }
      h3 {color: teal; font-family: 'Khand', sans-serif; }
   </style>
   ```

## Step 2: Add the Code to the Page

1. In the Admin sidebar of your store, go to **Content** > _Elements_ > **Pages**.

1. Find the page where the font is to be available, and open in edit mode. Then, scroll down to the **Content** section.

1. In the Page Builder panel under **Elements**, drag an **HTML Code** placeholder to a row, column, or tab set on the stage.

   Use the red guideline to position the divider either before or after another content container in the row, column, or tab set.

   _Drag HTML Code Element to Stage_

1. Hover over the container. Then in the toolbox, choose **Settings** ( ![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-settings.png %}){: .Inline}), and do the following:

   ![]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-elements-html-code-toolbox.png %}){: .zoom}
   _HTML Code Toolbox_

   - In the text box, paste the embed Google Fonts code and style declarations that you prepared. To make it easier to read, you can enter a few spaces to indent the code.

      ![]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-elements-html-code-example.png %}){: .zoom}
      _HTML Code and Styles_

   - Update the remaining settings as needed, using the [descriptions](#html-settings) at the end of this page for reference.

1. In the upper-right corner, <span class="btn">Save</span> the settings and return to the Page Builder workspace.

   The new font renders when the page is viewed through a browser.

1. To preview the page, do the following:

   - In the **Currently Active** section, set **Enable Page** to `Yes`.

      ![]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-elements-html-code-enable-page.png %}){: .zoom}
      _Enable Page_

   - In the upper-right corner on the **Save** menu, choose **Save & Close**.

1. Find the page in the grid. Then, select **View** in the _Actions_ column.
