Define your condition variances in the **Competitor Conditional Variances** section.

For **Conditional Variance**, select an option in the drop-down.

- **Use all competitor's product conditions**: (Default selection) Choose when you want your product to compare against any available condition (if a match does not exist for the condition you are listing).

- **Use Only Matching Competitor’s Product Condition**: Choose when you want your product to compare only against competitor's products in the same condition. If no match exists, the product will price at the Price Source.

- **Apply Variance (if competitor’s product condition differs)**: Choose to first try to compare against your matched product condition. If no matching condition exists, a variance (as a percentage) will be applied relative to your product condition and the lowest competitor’s condition.

   When the `Apply Variance` feature is selected, additional variance fields display for each of your Amazon conditions. This feature allows you to utilize intelligent repricing rules when you offer products that are in a different condition than your competitors. To understand the calculation behind conditional variance, you will need to first understand that all variance is determined from a base match price.

   Conditional variance options are only available when your listing settings for Condition are set to map condition values using a Magento product attribute. For all mapped conditions, you can denote a variance percentage of 1-100. The exception is collectibles, in which case a percentage greater than 100 may be applied.
