## How to Use this Guide

To help you get the most from the material, take a moment to become familiar with this guide. You’ll learn how the content is organized, explore the navigation, and be introduced to a few tools and resources.

### Main Menu

Use the main menu at the top of the page to explore other sections of the user guide. The topmost option of each section provides an overview with quick links and a table of contents. When you choose a topic, any additional topics in the section appear in a mini table of contents to the right. Use the breadcrumb trail or the Back button of the browser to return to previous topics.

### Display Modes

This guide has a responsive layout with three different display modes. When the window is resized, the format adjusts to the dimensions of a desktop, tablet, and smart phone. On a desktop, the full menu appears across the top of the page.

On a tablet or mobile device, the menu is hidden. Click the **Slide Out** “hamburger” button in the header to display the menu. Then, click it again to return to the current topic.

### Search

Use the **Search** box in the header to list topics that contain specific words. If there is a glossary definition of the search term, it appears at the top of the search results.
