## To complete the Price Rule General Settings section:

1. For **Rule Name** (required), enter the name for the rule.

   This is for your internal identification purposes only. The more descriptive the rule name, the better.

1. For **Description**, enter a detailed description of your rule.

   This could include information on the products that qualify, the active dates, the formula for calculating your adjusted price, or any other information you'd find useful if you ever needed to modify the rule.

1. For **Status**, select an option:

    - **Active**: Choose when you want the pricing rule to apply to your eligible products and adjust your listing pricing before publishing to Amazon.

    - **Inactive**: Choose when you do not want the pricing rule to apply to your eligible products. This option will most likely be used when modifying a pricing rule or turning it off after a limited promotion.

1. For **From** and **To**, enter a beginning and ending date for the pricing rule. You can also click the calendar icon to select a date from the dynamic calendar. This automatic start and stop option is beneficial when setting up limited-time or seasonal promotions with definite begin and end dates.

1. For **Priority**, enter a numerical value for the rule's priority. Priority value equal to 1 is the highest priority. When you have multiple active pricing rules, you can use priority to determine which rule is applied first. This field is required to use the Discard Subsequent Rules feature.

1. For **Discard Subsequent Rules**, select an option.

    - **Yes**: Choose when you do not want any other pricing rules that may apply to a product to be applied. Discarding subsequent rules means that, in the event that multiple pricing rules apply to the same product, only the pricing rule with the highest defined priority will be applied to a qualifying product. This prevents multiple pricing rules from stacking and providing unintended additional discounts.

    - **No**: Choose when you want to allow multiple pricing rules to apply to the same product. This could result in stacking and providing multiple discounts applied to your listing price.

To discard subsequent rules, a pricing rule must use priorities which are set in the **Priority** field.
