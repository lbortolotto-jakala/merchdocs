## To configure (B2B) Business Price settings:

1. Expand the **(B2B) Business Price** section.

1. For **Enable Business Pricing**, select an option (default is `Disabled`).

    - **Disabled**: Choose when you do not want to enable business-to-business sales. All other fields in this section are disabled when this option is selected.

    - **Enabled**: Choose when you want to enable your business-to-business sales. When enabled, the business price is set equal to the list price after all pricing rules have been applied. The business price follows the website pricing scope, if enabled. A business price can not be less than $1.

1. For **Enable Tiered Pricing**, select an option (default is `Disabled`).

    - **Disabled**: Choose when you want the same listing price for all order quantities. All Pricing Level fields in this section are disabled when this option is selected.

    - **Enabled**: Choose when you want to enable pricing that adjusts based on order quantity. When enabled, the Pricing Level quantity and discount fields enable.

1. Complete the **Pricing Level** settings.

   You can define up to five quantity/discount settings that set the tier pricing for your business listings. In each row, enter the quantity threshold value and the discount percent to apply. For example, if you enter 5 in the first field of the first row and 5 in the second field, when another business purchases a quantity of 5 or more, the price will apply a 5% discount.
