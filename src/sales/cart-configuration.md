title: Cart Configuration
---

The cart configuration determines the when the customer is redirected to the cart page, and which images are used for product thumbnails. You can require an order to reach a minimum amount before the checkout process begins, specify the number of days quoted prices remain valid, and specify the order of items in the Totals section.
