title: Shopping Cart

The cart is positioned at the end of the path to purchase, at the intersection of _Buy_ and _Abandon_, and is perhaps, the most important page in the store. The cart is where the order total is calculated, along with discount coupons and estimated shipping and tax. Itâ€™s a great place to show your trust badges and seals, and an ideal opportunity to offer one last item. You can choose the items to be offered as a cross-sell impulse purchase whenever a specific item appears in the cart.
