All orders have an order status that is associated with a stage in the order processing [workflow]({% link sales/order-status-workflow.md %}). The status of each order is shown in the Status column of the Orders grid. Your store has a set of predefined order status and order state settings. The order state describes the position of an order in the [workflow]({% link sales/order-status-workflow.md %}).
