title: Checkout
---

When the checkout process begins, the transaction shifts to a secure, encrypted channel. A padlock symbol appears in the address bar of the browser, and the URL changes from `http` to `https`.

From this point on, the goal is to gather the information necessary to complete the transaction. The Checkout page leads the customer through each step of the process. Customers who are logged into their accounts can complete checkout quickly, because much of the information is already in their accounts.

## Step 1: Shipping

The first step of the checkout process is for the customer to complete the [shipping]({% link sales/checkout-step1-shipping.md %}) address information, and to choose the shipping method.

## Step 2: Review and Payments

During the second step of the checkout process, the customer chooses the [payment method]({% link sales/checkout-step2-payment-review.md %}), and applies any coupons with promotional codes to the purchase. The [order confirmation]({% link sales/checkout-order-confirmation.md %}) appears after the order is placed. For registered customers, the page includes the order number with a link to the customerâ€™s account, and a link to generate a receipt.
