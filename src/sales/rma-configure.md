title: Configuring Returns

By default, RMA requests can be submitted by customers from the storefront. Requests to return individual items are managed by the Enable RMA attribute, which is managed in the Advanced Settings section of each product record, under [Autosettings]({% link catalog/product-autosettings.md %}). By default, the configuration settings are applied to the product. If Enable RMA is set to “No,” the product does not appear in the list of items that are available for return. An RMA can be generated only if there is an item in the order that is available for return. Changes to the value of the Enable RMA attribute apply to both new and existing orders.
