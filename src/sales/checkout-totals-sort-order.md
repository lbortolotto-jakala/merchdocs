title: Checkout Totals Sort Order
---

During Order Review, the total appears at the bottom of the order, with any adjustments for discounts, shipping charges, store credit, and tax. The order of each item determines the sequence of the calculations, and is set in the configuration by a number that is assigned to each item. For example, the Subtotal is the first item in the section, and is assigned a value of 10. The Grand Total appears last, and is assigned a value of 100. All of the other items in the totals section are assigned a value between those values.
