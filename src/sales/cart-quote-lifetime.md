title: Quote Lifetime

You can determine how long a price is valid by setting the cart quote lifetime in the configuration. For example, if a shopper leaves a cart unattended after several days, the quotes price for some items might no longer be the same. By default, the quote lifetime is set to thirty days.

## To configure the quote lifetime:

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, click **Stores**.

1. In the _Settings_ section, choose **Configuration**.

1. In _Sales_ section in the left panel, choose **Checkout**.

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}){: .Inline} the _Shopping Cart_ section.

1. In the **Quote Lifetime (days**)** field, enter the number of days that a quoted price remains valid.

1. Click **Save Config**.
