An invoice is a record of the record of payment for an order. Multiple invoices can be created for a single order, and each can include as many or as few of the purchased products that you specify. You can upload a high-resolution logo for a print-ready PDFÂ invoice, and include the [Order ID]({% link marketing/sales-documents-ref-id.md %}) in the header. To customize the invoice template with your logo, see: [PDF Logo Requirements]({% link marketing/sales-document-pdf-logo.md %}).
