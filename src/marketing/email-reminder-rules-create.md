title: Creating Email Reminders

Before setting up an email reminder rule, you must first set up a cart price rule to define the promotion that is being offered. Rule conditions that trigger an email reminder can be based on cart properties, wishlist properties, or both.

Email reminders might promote a cart price rule with, or without, a coupon. A cart price rule that defines an auto-generated coupon generates a random coupon code for each customer.

## To create an email reminder

1. On the Admin sidebar, tap **Marketing**. Then under **Communications**, choose **Email Reminder Rules**.

1. In the upper-right corner, tap <span class="btn">Add New Rule</span>.

1. Complete the Rule Information, as follows:

    ![]({% link images/images-ee/email-reminder-new.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Rule Information*

    * Enter a **Rule Name** to identify the rule internally.

    * Enter a brief **Description** of the rule.

    * To choose the **Cart Price Rule** promotion that this reminder is to advertise, tap <span class="btn">Select Rule…</span>. Then, select the rule.

        ![]({% link images/images-ee/email-reminder-select-rule.png %}){: .zoom}
        *Select Cart Rule*

    * If you want the rule to go into effect immediately, set **Status** to “Active”.

    * To set up a date range for the rule to be active, enter the **From** and **To** dates. You can also choose the date from the Calendar ( ![]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %}) ).

    * To send the reminder more than once, enter the number of days before the next email blast in the **Repeat Schedule** field.

        To repeat the reminder multiple times, separate the number of days with a comma. For example, enter “7” to trigger the rule again in seven days; enter “7,14” to trigger the rule in seven days, and again fourteen days later.

1. In the panel on the left, choose **Conditions**. At least one condition must be defined for the rule. The process is similar to building a [catalog price rule.]({% link marketing/price-rules-catalog.md -%})

    *Conditions*

    * Tap **Add** ( ![]({% link images/images/btn-add-grn.png %})) to display the list of options. Then, choose one of the following conditions:

        * Wish List
        * Shopping Cart

    * Complete the condition to describe the scenario that triggers the email reminder.

        ![]({% link images/images-ee/email-reminder-condition-example.png %}){: .zoom}
        *Completed Condition*

1. In the panel on the left, choose **Emails and Labels**.

    ![]({% link images/images-ee/email-reminder-rule-emails-labels-email-templates.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Email and Labels*

1. In the Email Templates section, choose the email template to be used for each website and store view in your [store hierarchy]({% link stores/websites-stores-views.md -%}).

    If you do not want to send the reminder email to customers of a store view, leave the value “Not Selected”.

1. In the Default Titles and Description section, do the following:

    * Enter the **Rule Title for All Store Views**.

        {: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
        This value can be incorporated into email templates by using the `promotion_name` variable.

    * Enter the **Rule Description for All Store Views**.

        ![]({% link images/images-ee/email-reminders-emails-and-labels-default-titles-description.png %}){: .zoom}
        *Default Titles and Description*

    * In the Titles and Descriptions Per Store View section, enter the Rule Title and Description for the **Default Store View**. For multiple store views, enter the appropriate title and description for each.

        {: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
        The description can be incorporated into email templates by using the promotion_description variable.

        ![]({% link images/images-ee/email-reminder-rules-title-descriptions-per-store-view.png %}){: .zoom}
        *Titles and Description per Store View*

1. When complete, tap <span class="btn">Save</span>.
