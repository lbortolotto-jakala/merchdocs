title: Setting Up a Gift Registry
---

A gift registry can be created for any type of event, such as a wedding, birthday, anniversary, new baby, or any other special occasion. By default, Magento includes the following special events:

* Baby
* Birthday
* Wedding

When you create a new registry, it becomes an option in the list of gift registry types in the customer’s account.

You can use one of the three prepared gift registries, or create your own custom registry. Each gift registry type includes a number of attributes, which are the data entry fields that a customer completes to create a gift registry. The attributes provide additional information about the event, time and location, or any other information that is needed. Depending on the input type, some attributes have multiple options. For example, the gift registry type “Wedding,” has the attribute “Role,” with the options, “Bride,” “Groom,” and “Partner”. To learn more about attributes and input types, see: [Attributes]({% link stores/attributes.md -%}).
