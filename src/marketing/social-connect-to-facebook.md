Magento Commerce has removed the "Magento Social" Facebook integration, and no longer supports the extension.

Magento Social is an [integration]({% link system/integrations.md -%}) that establishes a connection between your store and your Facebook account, and creates a shopping page with products from your catalog. When shoppers click a product on your Facebook page, they are redirected to the corresponding product page in your Magento store. All transactions take place from your Magento store.
