title: Managing Subscribers
---

As a best practice you should manage your subscription list on a regular basis, and make sure to process any requests to unsubscribe. In some jurisdictions, it is required by law that requests to unsubscribe are processed within a specific period of time.

If you want to use a third-party service to send newsletters, you can export your subscription list as a CSV or XML file.

## To cancel a subscription

1. On the Admin sidebar, tap **Marketing**. Then under **Communications**, choose **Newsletter Subscribers**.

1. Find the subscriber in the grid. Then, mark the checkbox in the first column.

1. Set the **Action** control to “Unsubscribe”. Then, tap <span class="btn">Submit</span>.

    The status of the record changes to “Unsubscribed”.

## To export the list of subscribers

1. From the Newsletter Subscribers list, use the filter controls to include only records with a **Status** of “Subscribed,” and for the appropriate website, store, or store view.

1. Set the **Export to** control to one of the following:

    * CSV
    * XML

1. Tap <span class="btn">Export</span>. Then, look for the prompt at the bottom of the screen, and save the file.
