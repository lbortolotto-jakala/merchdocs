title: Search Engine Robots
---

The Magento configuration includes settings to generate and manage instructions for web crawlers and bots that index your site. The instructions are saved in a file called “robots.txt” that resides in the root of your Magento installation. The instructions are directives that are recognized and followed by most search engines.

By default, the robots.txt file that is generated by Magento contains instructions for web crawler to avoid indexing certain parts of the site that contain files that are used internally by the system. You can use the default settings, or define your own custom instructions for all, or for specific search engines. There are many articles online that explore the subject in detail.

## Example: Custom Instructions

### Allows Full Access

    User-agent:*
    Disallow:

#### Disallows Access to All Folders

    User-agent:*
    Disallow: /

#### Default Instructions

    Disallow: /lib/
    Disallow: /*.php$
    Disallow: /pkginfo/
    Disallow: /report/
    Disallow: /var/
    Disallow: /catalog/
    Disallow: /customer/
    Disallow: /sendfriend/
    Disallow: /review/
    Disallow: /*SID=
