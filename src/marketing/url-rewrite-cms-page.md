title: CMS Page Rewrites
---

Before you begin, make sure that you understand exactly what the redirect is to accomplish. Think in terms of "target" and "source", or "redirect to" and "redirect from". Although people might still navigate to the former page from search engines or outdated links, the redirect causes your store to switch to the new target.

*Add URL Rewrite*

## Step 1. Plan the Rewrite

To avoid mistakes, write down the URL key of the "redirect to" page and "redirect from" page.

If you are not sure, open each page in your store, and copy the path from the address bar of your browser.

**CMS Page Path**

|Redirect to:|new-page|
|Redirect from:|old-page|
{:style="table-layout:auto"}

## Step 2. Create the Rewrite

1. On the Admin sidebar, tap **Marketing**. Then under **SEO &amp; Search**, choose **URL Rewrites**.

1. Before you proceed, do the following to verify that the "request path" is available.

    * In the search filter at the top of the **Request Path** column, enter the URL key of the page that is to be redirected. Then, tap <span class="btn">Search</span>.

    * If there are multiple redirect records for the page, find the one that matches the applicable store view. Then, open the redirect record in edit mode.

    * In the upper-right corner, tap <span class="btn">Delete</span>. When prompted, tap <span class="btn">OK</span> to confirm.

1. When you return to the URL Rewrites page, tap <span class="btn">Add URL Rewrite</span>.

1. Set **Create URL Rewrite** to “for CMS page”.

1. Find your new target page in the grid, and open in edit mode.

    *Custom URL Rewrite*

1. Under URL Rewrite Information, do the following:

    * If you have multiple store views, select the **Store** where the rewrite applies.

    * In the **Request Path** field, enter the URL key of the original page that the customer requests. This is the "redirect from" page.

        {: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
        The Request Path must be unique for the specified store. If there is already a redirect that uses the same Request Path, you will receive an error when you try to save the redirect. The previous redirect must be deleted before you can create a new one.

    * Set **Redirect** to one of the following:

        * Temporary (302)
        * Permanent (301)

    * For your reference, enter a brief description of the rewrite.

    ![]({% link images/images/url-rewrite-cms-page-information.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Custom URL Rewrite*

1. Before saving the redirect, review the following:

    * The link in the upper-left corner displays the name of the target page.
    * The Request Path contains the path for the original "redirect from" page.

1. When complete, tap <span class="btn">Save</span>.

    The new rewrite appears in the grid at the top of the list.

    ![]({% link images/images/url-rewrite-cms-page-saved.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Saved URL Rewrite*

## Step 3. Test the Result

1. Go to the home page of your store.

1. Do one of the following:

    * Navigate to the original "redirect from" page.
    * In the address bar of the browser, enter the name of the original "redirect from" page immediately after the store URL. Then, press **Enter**.

    The new target page appears instead of the original page request.
