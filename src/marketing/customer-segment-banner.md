A [banner]({% link cms/banners.md -%}) can target a specific [customer segment]({% link marketing/customer-segments.md -%}), and be incorporated into a [cart price rule]({% link marketing/price-rules-cart.md -%}). Because customer segments are dynamic, the price rule can adjust to changes in customer activity.
