![]({% link images/images/config-design-transactional-emails.png %}){: .zoom}
 [*Transactional Emails *]({% link design/configuration.md -%})

## Step 1. Upload Your Logo

1. On the Admin sidebar, tap **Content**. Then under **Design**, choose **Configuration**.

1. Find the store view that you want to configure. Then in the **Action** column, click **Edit**.

1. Under **Other Settings**, expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Transactional Emails** section. Then, do the following:

    * To upload your prepared **Logo Image**, tap <span class="btn">Upload</span>. Find the file on your computer, and select the file.

    * In the **Logo Image Alt** field, enter alternate text to identify the image.

    * Enter the **Logo Width** and **Logo Height** in pixels. Enter each value as a number, without the “px” abbreviation. These values refer to the display dimensions of the logo in the header, and not to the actual size of the image.

## Step 2. Choose the Header and Footer Templates

If you have custom header and footer templates for your store, or for different stores, you can specify which templates are used for each, according to the [scope]({% link configuration/scope.md -%}) of the configuration.

1. Choose the **Header Template** to be used for all transactional email messages.

1. Choose the **Footer Template** to be used for all transactional email messages.

1. When complete, tap <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.
