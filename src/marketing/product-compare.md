title: Compare Products
---

Compare Products generates a detailed, side-by-side comparison of two or more products. Depending on the theme, the Add to Compare link might be represented by an icon or text. The Compare Products block usually appears in either the left or right sidebar of a catalog page.

Unlike the [Recently Viewed / Compared Products ]({% link marketing/products-viewed-compared.md -%})block, the Admin does not include additional configuration settings for Compare Products.
