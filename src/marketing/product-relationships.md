title: Product Relationships
---

Products in your catalog can be promoted on other pages by defining the nature of the relationship between the products. The options available are: Up-sell products, Related products, and Cross-sell products.

[Related Products]({% link catalog/settings-advanced-related-products.md -%})
:  Related products are meant to be purchased in addition to the item the customer is viewing. They complement, enhance, or add optional features to the product.

[Up-sells]({% link catalog/settings-advanced-up-sells.md -%})
:  Up-sell products are items that are similar, but are perhaps of a higher-quality, more popular, or have a better profit margin than the item the customer is considering.

[Cross-sells]({% link catalog/settings-advanced-cross-sells.md -%})
:  Cross-sell products are offered on the shopping cart page as last-minute purchases before the checkout process begins.

[Related Product Rules]({% link marketing/product-related-rules.md -%})
:  Related product rules give you the ability to target the selection of products that are presented to customers as related products, up-sells, and cross-sells.
