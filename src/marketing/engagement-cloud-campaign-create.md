## Step 2: Add Your Campaign Content

Before you get started, it’s important to know that you can save your work at any time. If you log out and continue your work later, you can find the most recently saved version of your campaign in the menu under Campaigns > My Campaigns. To continue editing, find your campaign in the list, and click its name.

The content editor uses building blocks to represent each type of content that can be added to the template. The Build tab of the sidebar on the left displays the selection of building blocks that you can drag and drop into position. For this example, we will replace the sample content in the template with content of our own.

The following instructions walk you through each section of the template, and introduce editing and formatting tools, and techniques.

### Complete the Preheader (Optional)

The space above the header can be used to enter a brief message. You can either click the text box, and enter the text that you want to appear above the header, or delete the placeholder text.

### Upload Your Logo

1. On the **Build** tab, scroll down and expand the **Images** section.

1. To upload your logo, click **Manage**. Then, **click here** to upload the image.

1. Choose the image that you want to upload.

    Image manager is similar to Media Storage]({% link cms/media-storage.md %}), and is used to organize images that are available in your Engagement Cloud account.

    {: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
    It is recommended to limit the combined size of all images in a campaign to less than 100kb.

    ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-image-manager.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Image Manager*

1. To organize your images, click **New folder** in the upper-left corner. Then, enter a **name** for the untitled folder. The new folder is nested below the original parent folder.

    You can create as many folders as you need, and organize them any way you want. Over time you will upload many images to your account, and it’s important to organize them in a way that makes them easy to find.

1. In the sidebar, click the parent folder that contains the logo that you uploaded. Then, drag the image to the new folder. Then, click **Close** ( ![]({% link images/images/btn-engagement-cloud-close.png %})) in the upper-right corner to return to the content editor.

    ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-image-manager-new-folder.png %}){: .zoom}
    *New Folder*

    The logo that you uploaded appears in the sidebar, where it can be dragged into position.

1. Drag your logo to the header to replace the placeholder image in the template.

    *Drag Image to Template*

### Edit and Format Text

The next section of the template represents your store’s menu. However, it’s actually a building block with a multi-column layout, similar to a table. The text in each cell can be edited and formatted separately. The Columns building block iin the sidebar can be used in many ways to control the text layout.

1. Click the menu area to see the multi-column layout.  The Columns building block is located in the sidebar under Layout.

    ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-template-menu-5-column-layout.png %}){: .zoom}

1. Click each cell, and enter the menu options for your store. Then, use the toolbar to change the font, size, and style of the text, as needed.

### Add Links

To link each menu option in the template to your store, do the following:

1. Open your store in another window, and click the first menu option. Then, copy the full **URL**.

1. In the template, select the text for the first menu option. Then in the toolbar, click the **Hyperlink** ( ) tool.

1. In the **Link (URL) ** field, paste the link that you copied from your store.

1. Enter the **Link title**. Then, enter the **Link name** for tracking.

## Change the Background Color

In the sidebar, choose the **Styles** tab. Notice that Background layers is set to “Element table).” In the underlying HTML of the template, the menu background is actually part of a table.

In the template, hover over the menu background to highlight the entire row.

In the sidebar under the color picker, enter the hexadecimal code for the background color of your store’s menu. In the Magento Luma store, the background color of the menu is `#f0f0f0`.

Tap **Save colour** to save the color in the My colors section of the sidebar.

### Add Featured Products

Engagement Cloud gives you the ability to dynamically incorporate data from your store into a template. However, for this simple example, product data is added as static images with links to your store. Although this template includes two rows of products, only one row is included to reduce the number of images. The “Shop Now” blocks was also removed from the template, because it didn’t introduce any new editing techniques.

1. Upload the image for each featured product.

1. Edit the text, as needed, for each featured product.

    The price can be updated as any other text field. To change the currency, simply type a dollar sign, or any other currency symbol that you need.

1. To update the product buttons, click the button to display its settings in the sidebar.

1. Paste the **Button URL** for the corresponding product detail page.  Then, update the color and format of the button as needed.

1. Repeat these steps for each product button.

### Delete Blocks

To simplify this example, only one product block is needed from the template. You can delete the other two blocks that feature products from the catalog.

1. Find the block with the “Shop Women” and “Shop Men” tiles.

1. Hover over the outer container. Then in the upper-right corner, click **Delete** ( ![]({% link images/images/icon-delete-red-engagement-cloud.png %})).

    ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-block-delete.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Delete Block*

1. Delete the second product block, so only the one that you updated remains.

### Add Social Media Links

1. Scroll down to the “Sharing” block with the social media placeholders.

    ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-sharing-block.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Social Media Building Block*

1. In the building blocks sidebar under **Tools**, drag the **Social links** building block into position below the “Sharing” block with the placeholders.

    An empty social links block appears below the placeholder.

    ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-social-links-drag.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Social Media Building Block*

1. Click the empty building block to open the Social links settings.

1. Mark the checkbox of each social link that you want to include in the template.

1. For each social link, paste the **URL** of your company profile page.

    ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-social-links-settings.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Social Links*

1. To adjust the format and spacing of the buttons, click anywhere in the social links building block. You can experiment with these settings to adjust the size and format of the buttons. To make your buttons look like the template, do the following:

1. Under **Spacing**, set **Horizontal** to “15px” and **Vertical** to “None.”

![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-social-links-formats.png %}){: .zoom}
*Formatting the Social Media Links*

### Complete the Footer

The information at the bottom of the template is important, and in many countries is required by law. You must provide a mechanism for recipients to unsubscribe, and clearly identify the sender of the email.

1. Do not change the **Unsubscribe** and **Forward this email** links, because they contain code that manages each operation. However, you can format the text any way you like.

    ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-footer.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Unsubscribe / Forward This Email*

1. Click the **Footer info** text block, and enter your company information, including your registration number, if applicable, so recipients know who has sent the email.

    ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-footer-info.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Footer Info*

1. Click the **Company registered address** text block, and complete the information. In this example, we added a link to the Contact Us page on our site.

    ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-footer-commpany-registered-address.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Company Registered Address*

1. When complete, tap <span class="btn">Save</span>.

    The template is now fully customized for your store.

## Step 3: Send a Test

    ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-test-send.png %}){: .zoom}

1. Select the type of output you want to send from the following:

    * HTML and plain text

## Step 4: Review the Summary Report

The Summary Report validates the campaign, lists any errors that are found, and suggests areas for improvement. In addition to the Summary Report, the Reports menu has a selection of [Marketing Automation]({% link reports/customer-engagement.md %}) reports.

1. On the **Campaigns** menu, choose **My Campaigns**.

    ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaigns-my-campaigns.png %}){: .zoom}
    *My Campaigns*

1. In the record for your test campaign, click **Summary** ( ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-btn-summary.png %})) to view the summary report.

    Look for the red text in the report. They are tips and recommendations for things you can do to improve your campaign.

    *Campaign Summary Report*

## Step 5: Add a Personal Note

In this step, we’ll add a personal note with a link, and then do another test run.

1. On the **Build** tab of the sidebar under **Building blocks**, drag a **Text** block to the top of the template.

    ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaigns-personal-note.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Text Block for Personal Note*

    * Enter the word “Hi” to begin the greeting, followed by a blank space.

    * In the toolbar at the top of the template, tap <span class="btn">Data Fields</span>.

    * In the list of data fields, choose <span class="btn">First name</span>.

        ![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-data-fields.png %}){: .zoom}
        *Data Fields*

    * Write a note to accompany the campaign.

1. When complete, <span class="btn">Save</span> your work.
