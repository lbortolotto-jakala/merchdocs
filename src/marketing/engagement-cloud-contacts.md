Your Engagement Cloud account is [synced]({% link configuration/engagement-cloud/sync-settings.md %}) with your store, and maintains up-to-date address books of your customers, guests, and subscribers.

## To view your contacts

1. On the Engagement Cloud menu, choose **Campaigns** > **My campaigns**.

    The contact list in the main menu at the top of the page includes customer, guest and subscription data that is automatically imported from your store.

    The Contacts import report includes a summary of all subscribers as well as duplicates, failures, soft and hard bounces, invalid email addresses, and those who have unsubscribed, or have been blocked, globally suppressed, or otherwise blacklisted. You can use this report to help keep your data clean.
