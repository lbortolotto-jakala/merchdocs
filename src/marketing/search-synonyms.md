title: Search Synonyms
---

One way to improve the effectiveness of catalog search is to include different terms that people may use to describe the same item. You don’t want to lose a sale just because someone is looking for a “sofa,” while your product is listed as a “couch”. Or perhaps they spelled it wrong, or just differently. Is it a sweatshirt, or a sweat shirt? Maybe it is a fleece or a hoodie. You can capture a broad range of search terms by entering all the possible words a customer might use to find your products.
