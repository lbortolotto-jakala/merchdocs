title: Creating a Related Product Rule
---

The process of creating a related product rule is similar to setting up a price rule. First, you define the conditions to match, and then choose the products that you want to display. At any given time there might be a number of active rules that can be triggered to display related products, up-sells, and cross-sells. The priority of each rule determines the order in which the block of products appears on the page.

For an attribute to be used in a targeted rule, the [Use for Promo Rule Conditions]({% link stores/attributes-product.md -%}) property must be set to “Yes".

## To create a related product rule

1. On the Admin sidebar, tap **Marketing**. Then under **Promotions**, choose **Related Product Rules**.

1. In the upper-right corner, tap <span class="btn">Add Rule</span>.

    *Rule Information*

1. Complete the **Rule Information** as follows:

    * Enter a **Rule Name** to identify the rule when working in the Admin.

    * In the **Priority** field, enter a number that determine the order that the results appear on the page, when results from other rules target the same location. Number 1 is top priority.

    * To enable the rule, set **Status** to “Active”.

    * Set **Apply To** to one of the following:

      * Related Products
      * Up-sells
      * Cross-sells

    * If the rule is to be active for a specific range of time, enter the **From** and **To** dates.

    * In the **Result Limit** field, enter the number of records to appear in the results list. The maximum number is 20.

    * If the rule applies to a specific [customer segment]({% link marketing/customer-segments.md -%}), set **Customer Segments** to “Specified”. Then, choose the customer segment from the list.

1. In the panel on the left, choose **Products to Match**. Then, build the condition as you would for a [catalog price rule]({% link marketing/price-rules-catalog.md -%}).
