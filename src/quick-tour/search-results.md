Did you know that people who use search are nearly twice as likely to make a purchase as those who rely on navigation alone? You might consider these shoppers to be _pre-qualified_.

Your store has a Search box in the upper-right corner, and a link to Advanced Search in the footer. All of the search terms that shoppers submit are saved, so you can see exactly what theyâ€™re looking for. You can offer suggestions, and enter synonyms and common misspellings. Then, display a specific page when a search term is entered.
