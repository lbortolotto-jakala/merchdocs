To configure VAT ID validation, you must first set up the customer groups that are needed, and create the related tax classes, rates, and rules. Then, enable VAT ID validation for the store, and complete the configuration.

The following examples show how tax classes and rates are used for VAT ID Validation. Take a look at the examples, and then follow the instructions to set up the tax classes and rules that are needed for your store.

## Step 1: Create VAT-Related Customer Groups

VAT ID Validation automatically assigns one of the four default customer groups to customers according to VAT ID validation results:

- Domestic
- Intra-EU
- Invalid VAT ID
- Validation error

You can create new customer groups for VAT ID Validation or use existing groups, if they comply with your business logic. When configuring VAT ID Validation, you must assign each of the created customer groups as a default for customers with appropriate VAT ID validation results.

## Step 2: Create VAT-Related Classes, Rates, and Rules

Each tax rule is defined be three entities:

- Customer Tax Classes
- Product Tax Classes
- Tax Rates

Create the [tax rules]({% link tax/tax-rules.md %}) that you need to use VAT ID Validation effectively.

- Tax rules include tax rates and [tax classes]({% link tax/tax-class.md %}).
- Tax classes are assigned to [customer groups]({% link customers/customer-groups.md %}).

## Step 3: Enable and Configure VAT ID Validation

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. If necessary, set the **Store View** for the configuration.

1. In the panel on the left under **Customers**, choose **Customer Configuration**.

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Create New Account Options** section.
