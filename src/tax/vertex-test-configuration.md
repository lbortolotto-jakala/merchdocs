## Vertex API Automatically Disabled

When the Vertex connector is enabled and the **[Display prices in Catalog]({% link configuration/sales/tax.md %})** is set to `Including Tax`, updating your product prices in the Magento catalog to include tax could significantly degrade Magento performance. In this situation, the Vertex connector will automatically disable and you will see an error message in the [Vertex configuration page]({% link tax/vertex-configure-magento.md %}). You must set this value to `Excluding Tax` to re-enable the Vertex connector.

## Vertex Cache Management

When clearing caches using [Cache Management]({% link system/cache-management.md %}), Vertex has a cache option included. This option improves performance during the checkout process.
