title: System Config
---

To sync and add extensions, modules, and components from Magento Marketplace to your Magento Admin, you need to add and sync Marketplace access keys. The System Config page of the Web Setup Wizard saves allows you to add these keys and sync with Marketplace.

You need to generate, copy, and paste Marketplace access keys from your Marketplace account to the Magento Admin. Once added, the services remain in sync, including your purchased and added extensions.

## To synchronize Magento and Marketplace:

1.  Sign in to your [Magento Marketplace][1] account.

1.  To access your Magento authentication keys, on the _Developer_ tab, click **Access Keys**.

1.  Copy the **Public Access Key** and **Private Access Key** from your Marketplace account.

1.  In the Magento Admin, click **System** > **Web Setup Wizard**, and then click **System Configuration**.
