title: Cron (Scheduled Tasks)
---

Magento performs some operations on schedule by periodically running a script. You can control the execution and scheduling of Magento cron jobs from the Admin. Store operations that run according to a cron schedule include:

-  [Email ]({% link marketing/communications.md %})
-  [Catalog Price Rules]({% link marketing/price-rules-catalog.md %})
-  [Newsletters]({% link marketing/newsletters.md %})
-  [XMLÂ Sitemap Generation]({% link marketing/sitemap-xml.md %})
-  [Currency Rate Updates]({% link stores/currency-update.md %})

In addition, you can configure the following to run according to a cron schedule:

-  Order System Grid Updates and Reindexing
-  Pending Payment Lifetime

Make sure that the [base URLs]({% link stores/store-urls.md %}) for the store are set correctly, so the URLs that are generated during cron operations are correct. See [Set up cron jobs][1].
