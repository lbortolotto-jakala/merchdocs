title: System Upgrade
---

The System Upgrade tool can be used to upgrade your Magento installation from the Admin. The upgrade is a three-step process that should take place during off-peak hours. Before upgrade takes place, your store is put into maintenance mode, checked for readiness, and backed up.

We strongly recommend reviewing the latest [release notes][1] and [system requirements][2].

## Upgrade Requirements

-  Only the primary account holder is authorized to download code from the repository.
-  The authorization keys that are used to download code must be generated from the primary account.
<!--{% if "Default.EE-B2B" contains site.edition %}-->
-  The merchant or developer must submit a ticket to Support and request authorization for the download.
<!--{% endif %}-->

## Caching and Reindexing

Always flush the cache when upgrading from one version of Open Source or Commerce to another. Two upgrade examples include: upgrading from Magento Open Source 2.2.X to 2.3.X and upgrading from Magento Open Source 2.3.X to Magento Commerce 2.3.X.

For developer information on upgrades, see the DevDocs [Command Line Upgrade][3]. The upgrade instructions include scripts to help run and complete your upgrades. These steps require developer assistance.
