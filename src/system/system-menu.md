The System Menu includes tools to import and export data, install extensions, manage system caches and indexes, manage permissions, backups, system notifications, and custom variables.

The System menu is on the _Admin_ sidebar, click **System**.

-  [Data Transfer]({% link system/data-transfer.md %})
    
    The Import and Export tools give you the ability to manage multiple records in a single operation. You can import new items, and also update, replace, and delete existing products and tax rates.

-  [Extensions]({% link system/integrations.md %})
    
    Manage integrations and extensions for your store.

-  [Tools]({% link system/tools.md %})

    Manage your system resources, including cache and index management, backups, and installation settings.

<!--{% if "Default.EE-B2B" contains site.edition %}-->
-  [Support]({% link system/support.md %})

    The Support Tools can be used as a resource during the development and optimization processes, and as a diagnostic tool to help our Support team identify and resolve issues with your system.
<!--{% endif %}-->

-  [Permissions]({% link system/permissions.md %})

    Magento uses roles and permissions to create different levels of access for Admin users, which gives you the ability to grant permission on a “need to know” basis to people who work on your site.

<!--{% if "Default.EE-B2B" contains site.edition %}-->
-  [Action Logs]({% link system/action-log.md %})

    The Action Log tracks the activities of administrators who work in your store. For most events, the available information includes the action, the name of the user who performed it, whether it was a success or failure, and the ID of the object that was the target of the action. The Admin Actions archive lists the CSV log files that are stored on the server.
<!--{% endif %}-->

-  Other Settings

    Manage the [notifications]({% link stores/admin-message-inbox.md %}) in your inbox, create [custom variables]({% link marketing/variables-custom.md %}), and generate a new [encryption key]({% link system/encryption-key.md %}).

-  [Amazon Logs]({% link system/amazon-logs.md %})

    Provides access to Client and IPN logs, if enabled in the [Developer Options]({% link configuration/sales/amazon-pay.md %}) section of the [Amazon Pay]({% link payment/amazon-pay.md %}) configuration.
