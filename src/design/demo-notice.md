If your store is online, but still under construction, you can display a store demo notice at the top of the page to let people know that the store is not yet open for business. When you are ready to “go live,” simply remove the message. It’s like flipping the sign hanging in the window from “Closed” to “Open.” The format of the demo notice is determined by the theme of your store.
