title: Scheduling Design Changes
---

Design changes can be scheduled in advance, so they go into effect on schedule. You can use scheduled design changes for seasonal changes, promotions, or just to add variation.

## To schedule a design change:

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Content** > _Design_ > **Schedule**.

1. Click <span class="btn">Add Design Change</span>. Then under General Settings, do the following:

    ![]({% link images/images/design-schedule-change-new.png %}){: .zoom}
    _New Design Change_

1. Set **Store** to the view where the change applies.

1. Set **Custom Design** to the theme, or variation of a theme, that is to be used.

1. To define the period when the change is in effect, use the calendar (![]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %}){: .Inline}) to choose the values for the **Date From** and **Date To** fields.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.
