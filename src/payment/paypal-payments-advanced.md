**Payment Services Directive Requirements:** <br/>
As of September 14, 2019, European banks might decline payments that do not meet [PSD2]({% link stores/compliance-payment-services-directive.md %}) requirements. To comply with PSD2, PayPal Payments Advanced must be integrated with Cardinal Commerce. To learn more, see [3-D Secure for Payflow](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/payflow/3d-secure-overview/).

PayPal Payments Advanced is a [PCI-compliant]({% link stores/compliance-pci.md %}) solution that lets your customers pay by debit or credit card without leaving your site. It includes an embedded checkout page that can be customized to create a seamless and secure checkout experience.

Even customers without a PayPal account can make purchases through PayPal’s secure payment gateway. Accepted cards include Visa, MasterCard, Switch/Maestro, and Solo credit cards in the United States and United Kingdom. For additional convenience, PayPal Express Checkout is included with PayPal Payments Advanced.

You can have two PayPal solutions active at the same time: Express Checkout, plus any All-In-One or Payment Gateway solution. If you change payment solutions, the one that was used previously is disabled.
