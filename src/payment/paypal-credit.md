PayPal Credit offers your customers quick access to financing, so they can buy now and pay over time, at no additional cost to you. You are not charged when customers choose PayPal Credit, and pay only your normal PayPal transaction fee.

To learn more, see [PayPal Credit][1] on the PayPal website.

Give your sales a boost when you advertise financing. PayPal helps turn browsers into buyers with financing with PayPal Credit. Your customers can pay over time, while you get paid up front – at no additional cost to you. Use PayPal’s free banner ads that let you advertise PayPal Credit financing as a payment option when your customers check out with PayPal. The PayPal Advertising Program has been shown to generate additional purchases as well as increase consumer's average purchase sizes by 15% or more.

You can easily add free, ready-made banner ads to pages of your stie, and the PayPal Credit button to your shopping cart during checkout to remind your customers that financing is readily available.
 
For US merchants, PayPal Credit is included as a PayPal Express Checkout option, and is available with PayPal All-In-One Solutions (Payment Advanced, Payments Pro, and Payments Standard) and PayPal Payment Gateways (PayFlow Pro and PayFlow Link). Before you configure PayPal Credit for your Magento store, make sure it is enabled in your PayPal account.
