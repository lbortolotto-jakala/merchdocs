We are in the process of moving many popular payment integrations to Magento Marketplace. Don't worry if your favorite payment method has been marked as "Deprecated." You can find the latest official payment integration extensions in [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/extensions/payments-security/payment-integration.html?_ga=2.80488020.2105547619.1564067043-238341041.1564067043#q=&idx=m2_cloud_prod_default_products&p=0&hFR%5Bcategories.level0%5D%5B0%5D=Extensions%20%2F%2F%2F%20Payments%20%26%20Security%20%2F%2F%2F%20Payment%20Integration&nR%5Bvisibility_catalog%5D%5B%3D%5D%5B0%5D=1){:target="_blank"}.

Magento supports numerous payment solutions that offer merchant services in all parts of the world. Unlike some payment solutions that transfer control to another site to complete the transaction, a payment gateway makes it possible for you to accept credit card payments directly from your store without the customer leaving your site.
