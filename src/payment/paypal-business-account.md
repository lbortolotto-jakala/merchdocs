title: PayPal Business Account
---

To offer PayPal as a payment method in your store, you must have a PayPal [business account][1] and/or a PayPal Payflow account. The account requirements are specified in the description of each PayPal solution. Your PayPal merchant account is also used to manage any [fraud filters]({% link payment/paypal-fraud-management-filter.md %}) that are applied to purchases made from your store.

Customers who use PayPal Express Checkout or Express Checkout for Payflow Pro must have a PayPal buyer account. PayPal Payments Standard (which is some countries is called Website Payments Standard) can be used directly or through a buyer account, provided that the merchant enables PayPal Account Optional. By default, this parameter is enabled. Customers can choose to enter their credit card information, or create a buyer account with PayPal. When disabled, customers must first create a PayPal buyer account before making a purchase.

Website Payments Pro, Website Payments Pro Payflow Edition, Payflow Pro Gateway, and Payflow Link require customers to enter credit card information during checkout.
