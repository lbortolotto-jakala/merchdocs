**Payment Services Directive Requirements:** <br/>
As of September 14, 2019, European banks might decline payments that do not meet [PSD2]({% link stores/compliance-payment-services-directive.md %}) requirements. To comply with PSD2, PayPal Payflow Link must be integrated with Cardinal Commerce. To learn more, see [3-D Secure for Payflow](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/payflow/3d-secure-overview/).

PayPal PayFlow Link is available for merchants in the United States and Canada only. Customers are not required to have a personal PayPal account, and enter their credit card information in a form that is hosted by PayPal. The information is never stored on your Magento server. PayFlow Link cannot be used for orders that are created from the Admin.

Credit memos are supported for both online and offline refunds. However, multiple online refunds are not supported.

## Requirements

* [PayPal Business Account][1]{: target="_blank"} The PayPal Payflow Pro gateway links the merchant account at PayPal with the merchant’s website, and acts both as a gateway and a merchant account.  
* If you manage multiple Magento websites, you must have a separate PayPal merchant account for each website.

## Customer Workflow

| **1** | **Customer Goes to Checkout** | During checkout, the customer chooses to pay with PayPal PayFlow link, and enters the credit card information.The customer is not required to have a personal PayPal account.|
| **2** | **Customer Chooses Pay Now** | The customer taps the Pay Now button to submit the order.|
| **3** | **Customer Enters Credit Card Info** | The customer enters the credit card information on a form that is hosted by PayPal/If the customer clicks the Cancel Payment link, the customer returns to the Payment Information stage of checkout, and the order status changes to “Canceled.”|
| **4** | **Customer Submits the Order** | The credit card information is submitted directly to PayPal, and is not retained anywhere on the Magento site.|

## Order Workflow

1. **PayPal Receives Request**. PayPal receives the request from the customer to Pay Now.

1. **PayPal Verifies the Payment Information**. PayPal verifies the credit card information, and assigns the appropriate status.

   - **Payment Verified:** If verified, the “Pending Payment” the applicable status is initially assigned to the order until the transaction is settled.

     | **Processing** | The transaction was successful.|
     | **Pending Paymnet** | The system did not receive a response from PayPal.|
     | **Canceled** | The transaction was not successful for some reason.|
     | **Suspected Fraud** | The transaction did not pass some of the [PayPal fraud filters]({% link payment/paypal-fraud-management-filter.md %}). The system receives the response from PayPal that the transaction is under review by Fraud Service.|

   - **Cancel Payment:** If the customer clicks the Cancel Payment link, the customer returns to the Payment Information stage of checkout, and the order status changes to “Canceled.”

1. **Customer Is Redirected to Confirmation Page**. If the transaction completes successfully, the customer is redirected to the order confirmation page in your store.

   If the transaction fails on any reason, an error message appears on the checkout page and the customer is directed to repeat the checkout process. These situations are managed by PayPal.

1. **Merchant Fulfills Order**. The merchant invoices, and ships the order as usual.
