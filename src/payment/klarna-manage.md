The Klarna Merchant Portal makes it easy to manage orders, view transactions, and generate reconciliation reports. You can also manage your Klarna account settings, and add new users to your account.

Orders are captured with shipping details from the Magento Admin. Klarna also supports post order processing for events such as cancellations, refunds, and fraud.
