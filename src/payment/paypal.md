**Payment Services Directive Requirements:** <br/>
Beginning September 14, 2019, European banks may decline payments which do not meet [PSD2]({% link stores/compliance-payment-services-directive.md %}) requirements. For most PayPal solutions, no action is needed to comply with PSD2 because the requirements are handled by PayPal. For information about specific PayPal solutions, see the note at the top of each page.
