title: Bulk Assigning Sources
---

Use the Assign Sources tool to add one or more sources to your products. The tool helps when creating and assigning custom sources to your Default Stock or custom stocks and preparing new locations and inventory.

After adding new custom sources, you can add [inventory quantities per product]({% link catalog/inventory-product-quantity.md %}) or for multiple products through the Admin or using the [import feature]({% link catalog/inventory-import-export.md %}).

## To update quantities:

1. On the Admin sidebar, click **Catalog**. Then, choose **Products**.

1. Select the products you want to modify sources. Browse or search to find the products and select those checkboxes.

1. Click the <b>Actions </b>drop-down menu, and choose Assign Inventory Source. Click <b>OK </b>to verify.

The sources are added to the products with an inventory quantity of 0. You can add [inventory quantities]({% link catalog/inventory-product-quantity.md %}) per source.
