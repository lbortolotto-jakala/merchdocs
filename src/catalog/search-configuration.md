Magento offers a choice of search engines and versions, and supports both MySQL and Elasticsearch. The search engine configuration includes a set of general settings and additional features specific to the search engine. By default, Magento uses the MySQL search engine.

## MySQL

[MySQL]({% link catalog/search-mysql.md %}) is the default search engine used by Magento.

## Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch]({% link catalog/search-elasticsearch.md %}) is a powerful and highly scalable distributed search engine that is used by many industry leaders with high-volume sites.
