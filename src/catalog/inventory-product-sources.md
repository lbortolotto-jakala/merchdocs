title: Assigning Sources per Product
---

Before modifying quantities and settings, you need to assign [sources]({% link catalog/inventory-sources.md %}) to the products.

{% include unassign-source.md %}

## To assign sources to a product:

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Products**.

1. Locate and open a product in **Edit** mode.

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}){: .Inline} the **Sources** section.

   This section allows you to modify the source, update inventory quantities, and more.

    Currently, only Simple, Configurable, Virtual, Downloadable, and Grouped products support multiple sources. Bundle products can be created and managed with only the Default Source and Stock.
