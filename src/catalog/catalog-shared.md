Magento gives you the ability to maintain gated “shared” catalogs with custom pricing for different companies. In addition to the standard “master” product catalog, Magento provides customer access to two types of shared catalogs with different pricing structures.

If [Shared Catalog]({% link stores/b2b-features.md %}) is enabled in the configuration, the original master catalog continues to be visible from the Admin, but only the “default” public shared catalog is visible from the storefront. In addition, custom catalogs can be created that are visible only to members of specific [company]({% link customers/account-companies.md %}) accounts.

The Shared Catalogs grid lists the shared catalogs that are currently in existence, and provides tools to create and maintain the catalogs.
