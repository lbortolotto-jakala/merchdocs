Advanced Search lets shoppers search the catalog based on values entered into a form. Because the form contains multiple fields, a single search can include several parameters. The result is a list of all products in the catalog that match the criteria. A link to Advanced Search is in the footer of your store.

Each field in the form corresponds to an attribute from your product catalog. To add a field, set the frontend properties of the attribute to “Include in Advanced Search.” As a best practice, include only the fields that customers are most likely to use to find a product, because having too many will slow down the search.

1. In the Advanced Search form, full or partial values in as many fields as necessary.
