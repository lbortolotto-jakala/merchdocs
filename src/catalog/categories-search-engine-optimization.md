title: Search Engine Optimization
---

The Search Engine Optimization section specifies the [URL Key]({% link catalog/catalog-urls.md %}) and [meta data]({% link marketing/meta-data.md %}) fields that are used by search engines to index the category. Although some search engines ignore meta keywords, others continue to use them. The current [SEO best practice]({% link marketing/seo-best-practices.md %}) is to incorporate high-value keywords in both the meta title and meta description.
