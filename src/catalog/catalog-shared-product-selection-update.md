title: Updating the Product Selection
---

The selection of products in any shared catalog can be easily updated from the Action column of the Shared Catalogs grid. The changes you make are visible to members of any associated company accounts. The process is essentially the same as choosing products for a new [catalog structure]({% link catalog/catalog-shared-pricing-structure.md %}), except that the scope of the configuration cannot be changed.

*General Settings*

## To update the product selection:

1. On the Admin sidebar, tap **Catalog**. Then, choose **Shared Catalogs**.

1. Find the shared catalog in the grid. Then in the **Action** column, select **Set Pricing and Structure**.

1. Follow the instructions in [Step 1: Choose Products]({% link catalog/catalog-shared-pricing-structure.md %}). You can skip the first step, because the scope of a shared catalog cannot be changed after it is saved for the first time.
