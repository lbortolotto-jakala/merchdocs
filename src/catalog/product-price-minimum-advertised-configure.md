title: Configuring MAP
---

Your store’s MAP settings can be applied to all products in your catalog, or configured for specific products. When Minimum Advertised Price is enabled globally, all product prices in the storefront are hidden from view. There are a variety of configuration options that you can use to remain in compliance with the terms of your agreement with the manufacturer, while still offering your customers a better price.

On the global level, you can enable or disable MAP, apply it to all products, define how the actual price is displayed, and edit the text of the related messages and information tips that appear in the store.

When MAP is enabled, the product-level MAP settings become available. You can apply MAP to an individual product by entering the MSRP and choosing how you want the actual price to appear in the store. Product-level MAP settings override the global MAP settings.

            - In Cart
            - Before Order Confirmation
            - On Gesture (on click)

    1. Enter the text that you want to appear in the **Default Popup Text Message**.

    1. Enter any additional explanation that you want to appear in the **Default “What’s This” Text Message**.

        _Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price_

        - Enter the **Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price**.

            In this example, the product price is $54.00, and the MSRP is 59.95.

        - Set **Display Actual Price** to one of the following:

            | Use config | (Default) Applies the MAP configuration setting. |
            | On Gesture | Displays the actual product price in a popup when the customer clicks the “Click for price” or “What’s this?” link. |
            | In Cart | Displays the actual product price in the shopping cart. |
            | Before Order Confirmation | Displays the actual product price at the end of the checkout process, just before the order is confirmed. |

        {:.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
