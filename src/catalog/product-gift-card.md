There are three kinds of gift card products: virtual gift cards sent by email, physical gift cards, which can be shipped to the recipient, and a combination of the two. Each gift card has a unique code, which can be redeemed by only one customer during checkout. A [code pool]({% link catalog/product-gift-card-account-configuration.md %}) must be established before gift cards can be sold.

## Virtual
A [virtual gift card]({% link catalog/product-gift-card-workflow.md %}) is sent to the recipient by email. The order requires an email address for the recipient. A shipping address is not necessary.

## Physical
A [physical gift card]({% link catalog/product-gift-card-workflow.md %}) is shipped to recipient’s address, which is required during the purchase of the gift card.

## Combined
The [gift card]({% link catalog/product-gift-card-workflow.md %}) is shipped and emailed to the recipient. The recipient’s email and shipping address is required to purchase the gift card.
