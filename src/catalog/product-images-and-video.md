From the Images and Videos section, you can perform basic image management tasks such as upload multiple images, rearrange the order of images, and control how each image is used. For additional control over individual images you can open each image in “detail view.” To learn more, see: [Catalog Images and Video]({% link catalog/catalog-images-video.md %}).

## To upload an image:

1. Open the product in edit mode.

1. Scroll down and expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}){: .Inline} the **Images and Videos** section.

    ![]({% link images/images/product-simple-images-videos.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Images and Videos*

1. If you are ready to add a product image, do one of the following:

    * Drag an image from your desktop, and drop it on the **camera** (![]({% link images/images/btn-camera.png %}){: .Inline}) tile.

    * Tap the **camera** (![]({% link images/images/btn-camera.png %}){: .Inline}) tile, and navigate to the image file on your computer. Then, choose the image, and tap <span class="btn"> Open </span>.

A [placeholder]({% link catalog/product-image-placeholders.md %}) image appears in the catalog until a product image is available.
