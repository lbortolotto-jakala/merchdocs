title: Configuring Catalog Price Scope
---

If you have a multisite installation, make sure to configure the price scope before you create your shared catalogs. The [price scope]({% link catalog/catalog-price-scope.md %}) can be set to “Global,” or “Website”. However, it can be set only at the beginning of the setup process. The Website chooser appears during Step 2 of the shared catalog setup.
