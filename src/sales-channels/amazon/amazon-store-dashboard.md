title: Amazon Store Dashboard
---


On the Amazon Stores tab in Amazon Sales Channel Home, you can click any store name (in Active or Inactive status) to access the store's dashboard.

The store dashboard is the primary location for you to view the activity for one of your Amazon stores. With your Amazon Seller stores added and integrated, all orders and sales track through your store data view. On the dashboard, you can view revenue, track trends, and review sales data for all listings. All listings and sales are further grouped and tracked by listing type, including active, inactive, in-progress, incomplete, and orders awaiting shipment.

You can also review and update your store settings, integration settings, listing settings, price rules, order settings, and more from the store dashboard. On the dashboard, click one of your integrated stores. This store dashboard opens for stores in **Active** and **Inactive** status and displays data on sales, access for listings, and configuration options for the store.

The store dashboard includes the following sections and provides access to additional information:

- **Store Data**: Displays sales data and links to your listings by status.
- **Revenue**: Displays a graphical representation for the store's revenue for the last 7 or 30 days.
- **Most Recent Orders**: Displays the most recent orders that have been received from your Amazon listings association with the store.
- **I Want to See...**: Provides links to view and update your various store, listing, rules, and order settings.
