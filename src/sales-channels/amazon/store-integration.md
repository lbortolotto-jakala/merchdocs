To begin, create an Amazon Sales Channel store and connect it to your Amazon Seller Account. This integrates your Magento and Amazon accounts to share data, sync products, and more. You need your Amazon Seller Central account credentials to complete this step. You cannot continue with onboarding until you connect your stores.
