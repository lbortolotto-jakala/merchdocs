If you are managing a store that is in "In Setup" status, see [Onboarding: Price Rule Actions]({% link sales-channels/amazon/ob-pricing-rules-actions.md %}).

Price Rule Actions define the adjustment calculations that will be applied to the price source to determine the listing price.

A [standard price rule]({% link sales-channels/amazon/standard-price-rules.md %}) allows you to increase or decrease an Amazon listing price by a specific percentage or fixed dollar amount relative to the Magento catalog price (or price source).

An [intelligent repricing rule]({% link sales-channels/amazon/intelligent-repricing-rules.md %}) uses Amazon competitors' pricing to determine your listing price. Competitors are other sellers that are listing the same products you are listing on Amazon.
