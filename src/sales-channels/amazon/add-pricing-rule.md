title: Add Pricing Rules
---

Pricing rules are initially defined during onboarding, but can be modified at any time after your store setup is complete. You can access the Pricing rules for an Active or Inactive store in the [store's dashboard]({% link sales-channels/amazon/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}). In the **I Want To...** section, click **Pricing Rules**.

**Standard Price Rule:**
A standard price rule action allows you to increase or decrease an Amazon listing price by a specific percentage or fixed dollar amount relative to the Magento catalog price (or price source).

**Intelligent Repricing Rule:**
An intelligent repricing rule uses Amazon competitors' pricing to determine your listing price. Competitors are other sellers that are listing the same products you are listing on Amazon.

1. Select a store from [Amazon Stores]({% link sales-channels/amazon/managing-stores.md %}) on the Amazon Sales Channel Home.
