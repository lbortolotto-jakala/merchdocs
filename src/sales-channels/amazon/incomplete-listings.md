title: Incomplete Listings
---


Listings that display on this tab include your Magento catalog products that meet your Amazon eligibility requirements as defined in your listing rules but are missing information required by Amazon before listing (example: the Amazon ASIN or a defined product condition).

There are four possible causes for an incomplete listing, each identified by its status.

|Status|Reason|Action|

When incomplete listings are properly matched to your catalog products, the listing will move from the Incomplete tab and will publish to Amazon based on your [Product Listing Actions]({% link sales-channels/amazon/product-listing-actions.md %}) setting.

There are three available actions on the Incomplete Listings tab to correct an Incomplete listing.

In the **Actions** drop-down:

{% include amazon-re-attempt-auto-match-action.md %}

In the **Select** drop-down in the Actions column:

{% include amazon-update-required-info-action.md %}

{% include amazon-view-details-action.md %}
