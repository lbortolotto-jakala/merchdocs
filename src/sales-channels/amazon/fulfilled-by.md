|Product Fulfilled By|Options:<br/>**Fulfilled by Merchant**: (FBM) Select this if you fulfill the orders. When an order is placed, inventory will be deducted from your Magento catalog. When a new product is created, the fulfillment method of Merchant Fulfilled will be assigned.<br/>**Fulfilled by Amazon**: (FBA) Select this if Amazon fulfills the orders. With this fulfillment method, product inventory will not be deducted from your Magento catalog when an order is placed. When a new product is created it will be created with Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) as the fulfillment type. You will need to ensure that your products are eligible for FBA fulfillment within your Amazon Seller Central account. FBA inventory is also directly managed through your Amazon Seller Central account. With this fulfillment method quantity updates are not pushed out relative to your Magento catalog, so you will be unable to use some of the marketing tools described in the Quantity Settings.<br/>**Assign Fulfilled By Using Magento Product Attribute**: Select this if you have an existing Magento attribute that determines if it is fulfilled by the merchant or fulfilled by Amazon. When selected, the **Fulfilled by Attribute** field enables. |
