title: Creating and Assigning Products
---


When viewing New Third Party tab during onboarding or when managing your listings, you can match your Magento catalog products to an existing Amazon listing. There are two options for this matching. You can assign a listing to an existing catalog product, or you can use the information from the listing to create new catalog products. These options are helpful when your Amazon listings do not automatically match to your Magento catalog.

Assigning (or matching) your products to your Amazon listings is necessary to use the full feature set of Amazon Sales Channel.

When you create a new catalog product from an Amazon listing:

- The ASIN becomes the Magento SKU
- The Product Listing Name becomes the Catalog Listing Name
- The Price and Quantity are taken from the Amazon Listing

The rest of the necessary settings are determined by the Magento product settings you select during creation.

Once created and matched, the listings remove from the New Third Party tab and display on the Active tab.
