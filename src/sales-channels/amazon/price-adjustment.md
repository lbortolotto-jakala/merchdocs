{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
The Price Adjustment section is differs slightly for Standard and Intelligent repricing rules. The "Match Competitor Price" option is only available in the Price Action drop-down when the Rule Type field is set to " Intelligent repricing rule."

Sections of an intelligent repricing rule include:

- [Select Rule Type]({% link sales-channels/amazon/intelligent-repricing-rules.md %})
- [Competitor Conditional Variances]({% link sales-channels/amazon/competitor-conditional-variances.md %})
- **Price Adjustment**
- [Floor Price]({% link sales-channels/amazon/floor-price.md %})
- [Optional Ceiling Price]({% link sales-channels/amazon/optional-ceiling-price.md %})

The price adjustment determines what you do once you have identified the competitor price source.

## To configure the Price Adjustment section:
