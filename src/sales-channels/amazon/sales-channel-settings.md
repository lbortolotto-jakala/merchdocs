During installation of the extension, default values are applied for Amazon Sales Channel settings. These settings can be modified in your configuration settings for your Amazon store. These settings include:

- Dashboard view of the Revenue section
- Intervals for clearing Activity Log history
- Cron source selection
- Log synchronization options

## To modify your Amazon Sales Channel settings:

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. Scroll down and click **Sales Channels** and then **Global Settings**.

1. For **Show Dashboard Chart**, select an option.

    - **Yes**: (Default) Choose when you want the **Revenue** section to display on the store's [dashboard]({% link sales-channels/amazon/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}). If set to 'Yes', the **Revenue** section displays a graphical representation for the store's revenue for the last 7 or 30 days.

    - **No**: Choose when you do not want the **Revenue** section to display on the store's [dashboard]({% link sales-channels/amazon/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}).

1. For **Clear Log History**, select an option.

    - **Once Daily**: Select this option to clear your store's activity history once daily.

   Amazon Sales Channel logging is written to the `{Magento Root}/var/log/channel_amazon.log` file and can be viewed in [developer mode]({% link magento/installation-modes.md %}). Logging should only be `Enabled` during troubleshooting and should be `Disabled` when troubleshooting is complete.
