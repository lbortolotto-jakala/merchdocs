title: Managing Attributes
---


Amazon and Magento both use a system of product properties, known as attributes, used to define a product. Attributes define the description, content, images, prices, and various data for your products.

Successful communication between Magneto and Amazon requires that Magento attributes be correctly mapped to the corresponding Amazon attribute. When integrating with Amazon, you will link (or map) these Magento attributes to Amazon attributes. When complete, Magento can sync and maintain your Amazon listings with your Magento product catalog.

For example, imagine you have the same item in your Magento catalog and Amazon listings. One attribute for the product might be the listing price of the item. The name for the listing price in Magento might be named "Price," while the listing price for Amazon might be named "ListingPrice." You'll need to tell Magento that when communicating with Amazon, the Magento attribute named "Price" is the same as the Amazon attribute named "ListingPrice." This process is called managing attributes, and includes creating new and editing existing attributes. Making sure that attributes are properly matched will ensure correct communication between Magento and Amazon.

Once attribute matching is set up, Magento can communicate product information back and forth with Amazon. If you have Amazon product listings, Magento can import your Amazon products and details into your Magento catalog, allowing you to manage your Amazon listings from a single, central catalog of products.

The Amazon Sales Channel allows you to access, review, create, and manage attributes, as needed. If you add a new attribute to your Magento catalog, you may need to update those values across all products. For more information on Magento attribute sets and values, see [Product Attributes]({% link catalog/product-attributes.md %}).
