title: Ready to List
---


The Ready to List tab displays your Magento catalog meet your defined listing settings and are ready to publish to Amazon as a **new** listing. Depending on your [Product Listing Actions]({% link sales-channels/amazon/product-listing-actions.md %}) setting, this tab displays during [store review]({% link sales-channels/amazon/ob-store-review.md %}) in onboarding and when managing listings from your [store dashboard]({% link sales-channels/amazon/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}).

The Ready to List tab only displays when your [Automatic List Action]({% link sales-channels/amazon/product-listing-actions.md %}) field in your listing settings is set to "Do Not Automatically List Eligible Products." This setting tells Amazon Sales Channel that any new Amazon listings must be published manually.

When the field is set to "Automatically List Eligible Products," Amazon Sales Channel automatically publishes new listings for your eligible catalog products. Since new listings are published automatically, this tab does not display.

In this tab, you can sort your active published listings using the columns provided, or add and remove columns as needed. You can also perform several actions for a listing.

You have a few options to manually publish a new listing to Amazon.

1. In the left-side column, click to check each of the listings you wish to publish.

1. In the Action drop-down, click **Publish Product to Amazon**.

## To publish a single catalog product to a new Amazon listing

1. In the Action column for the listing, click **Select** and click **Publish on Amazon**.

A confirmation message displays that the product is scheduled to be listed on Amazon.

Listing information is published to Amazon based on your cron settings. Listing information will send to Amazon at the next data sync. Until Amazon replies with the listing confirmation, the manually published listing(s) remains on the Ready to List tab with a status of "List in Progress." Once the listing confirmation is received from Amazon, the listing(s) removes from the Ready to List tab and displays in the Active tab with a status of "Active."
