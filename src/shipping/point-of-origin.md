title: Point of Origin
---

The point of origin is used to calculate the charge for shipments made from your store or warehouse, and also determines the tax rate for products sold. When calculating [EU taxes]({% link tax/guidelines-eu.md %}), make sure that the [Default Tax Destination Calculation]({% link configuration/sales/tax.md %}) for each store view corresponds to the Shipping Settings point of origin.
