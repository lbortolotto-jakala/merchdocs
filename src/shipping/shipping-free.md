title: Free Shipping
---

Free shipping is one of the most effective promotions you can offer. It can be based on a minimum purchase, or set up as a [cart price rule]({% link marketing/price-rules-cart.md %}) that is applied when a set of conditions is met. If both apply to the same order, the configuration setting takes precedence over the cart rule.

## Step 1: Configure Free Shipping

1.  On the Admin sidebar, tap **Stores**.

1.  In the _Settings_ section, choose **Configuration**.

1.  In the _Sales_ secion in the left panel, choose **Shipping Methods**.

1.  Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Free Shipping** section. Then, do the following:

1.  Set **Enabled** to “Yes”.

1.  Enter a **Title** to identify the Free Shipping method during checkout.

1.  Enter a **Method Name** to describe this shipping method.

1.  Enter the **Minimum Order Amount** to qualify for free shipping.

    {: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
    To use Free Shipping with [Table Rates]({% link shipping/shipping-table-rate.md %}), make the Minimum Order Amount so high that it is never met. This prevents Free Shipping from going into effect, unless it is triggered by a price rule.

1.  In the **Displayed Error Message** box, type the message to appear if free shipping becomes unavailable.

1.  Set **Ship to Applicable Countries** to one of the following:
    
    * **All Allowed Countries**–Customers from all [countries]({% link stores/country-options.md %}) specified in your store configuration can use free shipping.

    * **Specific Countries**–After choosing this option, the Ship to Specific Countries list appears. Select each country in the list where free shipping can be used.

1.  Set **Show Method if Not Applicable** to one of the following:

    *  **Yes**–Always shows the Free Shipping method, even when not applicable.
    *  **No**–Shows the Free Shipping method only when applicable.

1.  Enter a **Sort Order** number to determine the position of free shipping in the list of shipping methods during checkout. (0 = first, 1 = second, 2 = third, and so on.)

1.  Click **Save Config**.

## Step 2: Enable Free Shipping in the Carrier Configuration

Make sure to complete any configuration that is required for each carrier that you plan to use for free shipping. For example, if your UPS configuration is otherwise complete, make the following settings to enable and configure free shipping:

1.  From the Shipping Methods configuration, click to expand the **UPS** section.

1.  Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **UPS** section.

1.  Set **Free Method** to “Ground”.

1.  To require a minimum order for free shipping, set **Free Shipping with Minimum Order Amount** to “Enable”.

1.  Enter the required amount in the **Minimum Order Amount for Free Shipping** field.

1.  Click **Save Config**.
