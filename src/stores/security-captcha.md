title: CAPTCHA
---

A CAPTCHA is a visual device that ensures that a human being, rather than a computer, is interacting with the site. CAPTCHA is an acronym for _Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart_. It can be used for both Admin and customer account logins.

You can reload the CAPTCHA as many times as is necessary by clicking the Reload icon in the upper-right corner of the image. The CAPTCHA is fully configurable and can be set appear every time, or only after a number of failed login attempts.

## Admin CAPTCHA

For an extra level of security, you can add a CAPTCHA to the Admin Sign In and Forgot Password page. Magento Admin users can reload the displayed CAPTCHA by clicking the Reload ![]({% link images/images/btn-reload.png %}) icon in the upper-right corner of the image. The number of reloads is unlimited.

    - **Enable CAPTCHA in Admin** — Set to `Yes`.

    - **Font** — Enter the name of the font to be used for the CAPTCHA symbols (default: `LinLibertine`).

      - `After number of attempts to login` — When selected, displays the _Number of Unsuccessful Attempts to Login_ field. Enter the number of login attempts allowed. A value of 0 (zero) is similar to setting Displaying Mode to `Always`. This option does not cover the _Forgot Password_ form. If CAPTCHA is enabled and set to be appear on this form, then it is always included on the form.

    - **Number of Unsuccessful Attempts to Login** — Enter the number of times the user can make an unsuccessful login attempt before the CAPTCHA appears. If set to zero (`0`), CAPTCHA is always used.

    - **CAPTCHA Timeout (minutes)** — Enter the number of minutes before the CAPTCHA expires. When the CAPTCHA expires, the user must reload the page.

    - **Symbols Used in CAPTCHA** — Specify the symbols that can be used in the CAPTCHA. Only letters (a-z and A-Z) and numbers (0-9) are allowed. The default set of characters does not include similar symbols such as I or 1. For best results, use symbols that users can readily identify.

    - **Case Sensitive** — Set to `Yes` to require that users enter the characters exactly as shown in the CAPTCHA.
