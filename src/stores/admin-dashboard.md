The dashboard is usually the first page that appears when you log in to the Admin, and gives an overview of sales and customer activity. The blocks on the left provide a snapshot of lifetime sales, average order amount, the last five orders, and search terms. The graph shows the orders and amounts for the selected date range. You can use the tabs above the graph to toggle between the two views. The tabs at the bottom provide quick reports about your best-selling products, most viewed products, new customers, and customers who have purchased the most.

The dashboard is the default [startup page]({% link configuration/advanced/admin.md %}) for the Admin, although you can change the configuration to display a different page when you log in. You can also set the starting dates used in dashboard reports and disable the display of the charts section.

You can produce Dashboard snapshot reports for each store view. The tabs at the bottom of the page summarize your best-selling and most viewed products, new customers, and those who have purchased the most during the time period specified.
