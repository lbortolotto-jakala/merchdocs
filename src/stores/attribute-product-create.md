## Step 4: Describe the storefront properties

1. In the left side panel, choose **Storefront Properties**.

1. If the attribute is to be available for search, set **Use in Search** to `Yes`.

1. To include the attribute in catalog page listings, set **Visible on Catalog Pages on Storefront** to `Yes`.

1. Complete the following settings if supported by your theme:

   - To include the attribute on the product detail page, set **Visible on Catalog Pages on Storefront** to `Yes`.

   - To include the attribute in product listings, set **Used in Product Listing** to `Yes`.
