A formula combines multiple metrics and mathematical logic to answer a question. For example, how much of the revenue per product during the holiday season was generated by new customers?

## Step 1: Create the Basic Report

1. In the menu, choose **Report Builder**.

1. Click <span class="btn">Add Metric</span>, and choose the first metric for the report.

    This example uses the “Revenue by products ordered” metric.

1. Click <span class="btn">Add Metric</span> again, and choose the second metric for the report.

    This example uses the “New Customers” metric.

1. In the sidebar, click **Details** to display information about each metric.

1. To return to your report, click the previous browser tab.

1. In the chart, hover over a few data points on each line to see the amounts associated with each metric.

## Step 2: Add a Formula

1. At the top of the sidebar, click <span class="btn">Add Formula</span>.

    The formula box shows the metrics as available inputs A and B, and includes an input box where you can enter the formula.

    Do the following:

    * In the **Enter your Formula** input box, enter “A/B”.

        This will divide the revenue by products ordered by the number of new customers.

    * Set **Select format** to “123Number”.

    * In the sidebar, replace “Untitled” with a name for the formula.

    *Formula Settings*

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Apply</span>.

    The report now has a new line for the formula, “New Customer Revenue”, and the sidebar shows the total amount of revenue generated by new customers.

## Step 3: Add a Date Range

1. Click the **Date Range** control in the upper-right corner.

1. On the **Fixed Date Range** tab, do the following:

    * On the calendars, choose the date range.

        For this example, the holiday season is from November 1 through December 31.

    * Under **Select Time Interval**, choose “Day”.

        *Fixed Date Range*

    * When complete, click <span class="btn">Apply</span>.

    The report is now limited to the holiday season, with a data point for each day.

## Step 4: Save the Report

In this step, you will save the report as a chart, and also as a table.

1. Click the “Untitled Report” text at the top of the page, and enter a descriptive title. For this example, the report title is “2017 Holiday Sales”.

    Then, do the following:

    * In the upper-right corner, click **Save**.

    * For **Type**, accept the default setting, “Chart”.

    * Choose the **Dashboard** where the report is to be available.

    * Click **Save to Dashboard**.

1. Click the report title, and change the name.

   This example changes the report title to “2017 Holiday Sales Data”.

    Then, do the following:

    * In the upper-right corner, click <span class="btn">Save a Copy</span>.

    * Set **Type** to “Table”.

    * Choose the **Dashboard** where the report is to be available.

    * Click **Save a Copy to Dashboard**.

1. To see the reports in your dashboard, do one of the following:

    * Click **Go to Dashboard** in the message at the top of the page.

    * In the menu, choose **Dashboards**. Click the name of the current dashboard to display the list. Then, click the name of the dashboard where the report was saved.
