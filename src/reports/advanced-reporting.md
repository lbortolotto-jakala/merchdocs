Advanced Reporting is a free, cloud-based service that is powered by [Magento Business Intelligence]({% link reports/business-intelligence.md %}).

The initial release of Advanced Reporting supports only one base currency.

## Step 1: Enable Advanced Reporting

In the Magento configuration, [Advanced Reporting]({% link configuration/general/advanced-reporting.md %}) is enabled by default, and starts automatically if cron is [configured]({% link configuration/advanced/system.md %}) and running. An attempt to establish the subscription is initiated at the beginning of each hour over the next 24-hours until successful. The subscription status is “pending” until the subscription is successfully established.

1. On the Admin sidebar, choose **Stores**. Then under **Settings**, choose **Configuration**.

1. In the panel on the left, choose **General**. Then under **Advanced Reporting**, do the following:

   * Verify that **Advanced Reporting Service** is set to “Enable”. (This is the default setting.)

   * Set the **Time of day to send data** to the hour, minute, and second, according to a 24-hour clock, that you want the service to receive updated data from your store. By default, data is sent at 2:00 AM.

   * Under **Industry Data**, choose the **Industry** that best describes your business.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.

1. When prompted, click the [Cache Management]({% link system/cache-management.md %}) in the message at the top of the page. Then, refresh any invalid caches.

1. Wait overnight, or until after the time of your next scheduled update. Then, check the status of your subscription. If the status is still “pending,” make sure that your installation meets all of the requirements.

## Step 2: Access Advanced Reporting

1. Do one of the following:

   * In the Admin sidebar, choose **Dashboard**. Then, click <span class="btn">Advanced Reporting</span>.
   * On the Admin sidebar, choose **Reports**. Then under **Business Intelligence**, choose **Advanced Reporting**.

1. To get a better view of the data, set the **Filters** in the upper-right corner to the time period and store view that you want to include in the report. Then, do the following:

   * Hover over any data point for more information.
   * Click each tab to see all dashboard reports.
