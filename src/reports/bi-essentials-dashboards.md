BI Dashboards give you a quick view of your store’s performance and sales activity at a glance. Individual dashboards can be shared with other users, and organized into logical groups. You can also set different levels of permission to others users.

It’s easy to create a new report, add it to a dashboard, and export the data to Excel. Charts and reports can be resized and dragged into position on the dashboard.
